\section{Materials}
This study will employ components to gather accurate measurements of reaction time. The device will be composed of one master controller and multiple stations. The study will use the ESP-NOW protocol to achieve wireless connection between the main controller and the stations. ESP-NOW is a wireless communication protocol defined by Espressif which enables multiple ESP based microcontrollers to communicate wirelessly. It is a quick and low-power way to handle connection that is based on the data link layer to achieve faster transmission. The main controller will be the master for the station controllers who will send commands and where data will be gathered and sent to a web-based player development tracker.
